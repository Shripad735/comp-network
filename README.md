# Line Coding Visualizer

## Description

The Line Coding Visualizer is an interactive web application built with React that allows users to visualize various line coding techniques used in digital communication systems. This tool is designed to help students, educators, and professionals understand and compare different line coding schemes.

## Features

- Support for 7 line coding techniques:
  - NRZ-L (Non-Return to Zero Level)
  - NRZ-I (Non-Return to Zero Inverted)
  - RZ (Return to Zero)
  - Manchester
  - Differential Manchester
  - AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion)
  - Pseudoternary
- Interactive input for binary data
- Real-time visualization of encoded data
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shripad735/line-coding-visualizer.git
   cd line-coding-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Enter your binary data (consisting of 0s and 1s) in the input field.
2. Select a line coding technique from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Encode" button to visualize the encoded data.
4. The encoded data will be displayed both as text and in a line chart.
5. Use the "Clear" button to reset the input and chart.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
